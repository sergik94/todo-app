Dear User,

welcome to TODO App. It doesn't need installation. The program is available at the [link](https://sergik94.github.io/todo-app/). But if you want to run app locally:
  - clone current repository to your PC
  - type in the Terminal:
    - npm i;
    - npm start.

The following features are implemented:
  - downloading tasks from the server ('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com');
  - the ability to add new tasks, as well as edit and delete existing ones;
  - Tasks are displayed in groups of up to 20 tasks each.
  - Group management is implemented using pagination buttons.
  - The current group (page) is displayed in the URL search options bar.
  - If any error occurs, you will receive a corresponding message.

Note: The data on the server will not be updated. The current API only allows you to test code. You can only add one task and will not be able to edit it after that.
